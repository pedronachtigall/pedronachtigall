I like to design novel tools and integrate available approaches to convert data into biological knowledge. I consider myself a computational biologist with highly enthusiasm of using and integrating novel technologies to study evolution, ecology, and genetics. Currently, I am using high-throughput sequencing methodologies to better understand venom evolution in snakes.

I have 10+ years of experience in bioinformatics, statistics, programming, software engineering, pipeline development, and high-throughput sequencing data analysis. I have a wide experience in a variety of 'omic' data (genomics, epigenomics, transcriptomics, and proteomics) generated by short- and/or long-reads methodologies.
